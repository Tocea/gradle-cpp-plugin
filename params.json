{"name":"Gradle-cpp-plugin","tagline":"Gradle C/C++ plugin with CMake interaction","body":"##Overview\r\n\r\nThe gradle-cpp-plugin can be used to build c++ projects. This plugin does not compile directly c++ source files, but let the 'traditionals c tools' (cmake, make,…) to do it. The plugins task just call these tools.\r\n\r\nThe plugins add these features to the 'tradionals c tools' : \r\n\r\n* Dependencies management\r\n* Structure directories conventions\r\n* Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) of tasks (compilation --> test --> assembly --> deploy\r\n* Packaging\r\n* Deployment on remote repository (ex. Nexus)\r\n* possibility to create multi-modules project\r\n\r\n##Documentations\r\n\r\n* [Test reports](spock-reports/1.2.9/\")\r\n* [Groovydoc](groovydoc/1.2.9/)\r\n* [The readme](https://github.com/Tocea/gradle-cpp-plugin/blob/master/README.md)\r\n\r\n## Continuous Integration\r\n\r\nThe gradle-ccp-plugin use [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/Tocea/gradle-cpp-plugin) continuous integration server. [Coveralls](https://coveralls.io/github/Tocea/gradle-cpp-plugin) is used for code coverage. Releases versions are deployed on the [Gradle plugin repository](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/fr.echoes.gradle.cpp\") and can be used directly for every c++ project. \r\n\r\n## Modules\r\nTo simplify the configurations of the C build tools, some modules are provided. At this time only cmake modules are provided.\r\n\r\nProvided lists : \r\n* [CMake modules](https://github.com/Tocea/gradle-cpp-plugin/blob/master/docs/modules/cmake-modules.md)\r\n\r\n## Authors and Contributors\r\n\r\n* Jérémie Guidoux (@jguidoux)\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
